# PSHammy -> WSJT-X Contact Relay to Discord
PSHammy is a module that interprets WSJT-X's log file, and posts contacts to a Discord channel via webhook

## Getting Started

### Requirements
You will need PowerShell 5.1 if you're on Windows at a minimum. I strongly reccommend installing and using [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), as it is cross-platform, open-source, and the future of PowerShell.
